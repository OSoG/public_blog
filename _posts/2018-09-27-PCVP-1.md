Introduction to CV
CV?
: automated extraction of information from images
imformation?
: anything from 3D models, camera position, object detection and recognition to grouping and searching image content

Sometimes CV tries to mimic human vision

Python and NumPy

When programming CV, we need representations of vectors and matrices and operations on them.
This is handled by Python's NumPy module
