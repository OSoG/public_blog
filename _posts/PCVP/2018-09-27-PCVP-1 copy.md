Chapter 1 Basic image handling and processing

# 1.1 PIL - the python imaging library

the most important module is the image module.
to read an image, use:

```
from PIL import Image
pil_im = Image.open(empire.jpg)
```

The return value, pil_im, is a PIL image object

color conversions are done using the convert() method
to read an image and convert it to grayscale, just add convert ('L')

```
pil_im = Image.open('empire.jpg').convert('L')
```
